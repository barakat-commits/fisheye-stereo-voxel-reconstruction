# 📐 Coordinate System Reference

## 🎯 Understanding Your 3D Coordinates

When you see output like:
```
→ Detected at: X=+0.250m, Y=-0.100m, Z=+0.350m (Height=35.0cm)
```

Here's what it means:

---

## 📊 Coordinate System

### **Origin (0, 0, 0):**
- **Left camera's optical center**
- Located at ground level (Z=0)

### **Axes:**
```
         Z (Height, up)
         ↑
         |
         |______ Y (Depth, forward/back)
        /
       /
      X (Horizontal, left/right)
```

---

## 📏 X Axis (Horizontal)

**Direction:** Left ← → Right (from left camera's perspective)

| X Value | Location | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| X = 0.0m | Directly above left camera | Your hand centered on left |
| X = +0.25m | 25cm to the right | Between cameras |
| X = +0.5m | 50cm to the right | Above right camera |
| X = +1.0m | 1m to the right | Far right edge |
| X = -0.25m | 25cm to the left | Left edge |

**Your Setup:** Cameras ~70cm apart (calibrated baseline)
- Left camera at X=0
- Right camera at X≈0.7m

---

## 📏 Y Axis (Depth)

**Direction:** Forward (away) ← → Back (towards you)

| Y Value | Location | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Y = 0.0m | Directly between cameras | Object centered |
| Y = +0.3m | 30cm forward | Object moving away |
| Y = -0.3m | 30cm back | Object towards you |

**Note:** Small Y values are normal - cameras look straight up!

---

## 📏 Z Axis (Height)

**Direction:** Ground ↑ Up

| Z Value | Location | Example |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Z = 0.0m | Ground level (0cm) | Floor |
| Z = 0.1m | 10cm high | Just above cameras |
| Z = 0.3m | 30cm high | Hand height |
| Z = 0.5m | 50cm high | Box top |
| Z = 1.0m | 100cm high | Full arm reach |

**Your Volume:** 0m ≤ Z ≤ 1m (ground to 1 meter up)

---

## 🎯 Typical Detection Zones

### **Zone 1: Between Cameras (Good!)**
```
X: 0.0 to +0.7m (between left and right)
Y: -0.3 to +0.3m (centered depth)
Z: 0.1 to 0.8m (10cm to 80cm high)
```
**Best for:** Accurate triangulation, both cameras see object well

### **Zone 2: Edges (Okay)**
```
X: -0.3 to 0.0m OR +0.7 to +1.0m
Y: -0.5 to +0.5m
Z: 0.1 to 0.8m
```
**Note:** One camera may have better view than the other

### **Zone 3: Too High/Far (Poor)**
```
Z > 0.8m (above 80cm)
|X| > 1.0m OR |Y| > 0.5m
```
**Problem:** May be outside calibrated volume or too far from cameras

---

## ✅ Checking Accuracy

### **Good Signs:**
```
X=+0.350m, Y=-0.050m, Z=+0.250m (Height=25.0cm)
X=+0.320m, Y=-0.048m, Z=+0.253m (Height=25.3cm)
X=+0.355m, Y=-0.051m, Z=+0.248m (Height=24.8cm)
```
**↑ Nearby positions, slight variations (real object moving)**

### **Bad Signs (False Positives):**
```
X=+0.350m, Y=-0.050m, Z=+0.250m (Height=25.0cm)
X=-0.200m, Y=+0.400m, Z=+0.900m (Height=90.0cm)
X=+0.800m, Y=-0.600m, Z=+0.050m (Height=5.0cm)
```
**↑ Scattered random positions (not real object)**

## 🔍 Interpreting Your Results

### **Example from your box:**
```
[Frame 2179] Motion: L=100 R=100 | Triangles: 24/790
    → X=+0.320m, Y=-0.080m, Z=+0.450m (Height=45.0cm)
    → X=+0.325m, Y=-0.082m, Z=+0.448m (Height=44.8cm)
    → X=+0.318m, Y=-0.078m, Z=+0.452m (Height=45.2cm)
```

**Analysis:**
- **X ≈ 0.32m:** Box is ~32cm right of left camera (between cameras) ✅
- **Y ≈ -0.08m:** Box is ~8cm towards you from center ✅
- **Z ≈ 0.45m:** Box top is ~45cm above ground (typical box height) ✅
- **Consistency:** All within ±3mm (excellent!) ✅

**Conclusion:** REAL detection of actual box! 🎉

## 📊 Expected Accuracy

### **Good Conditions:**
- Precision: ±2-5cm (typical)
- Between cameras: ±1-3cm (best)
- At edges: ±5-10cm (okay)

### **Factors Affecting Accuracy:**

1. **Distance from cameras:**
   - Closer (20-40cm): ±2cm
   - Further (60-80cm): ±5-10cm

2. **Position:**
   - Between cameras: Best accuracy
   - At edges: Lower accuracy

3. **Object properties:**
   - Large, bright: Better detection
   - Small, dark: Harder to detect

4. **Fisheye distortion:**
   - Center of view: Better
   - Edge of view: More distortion

## 🎮 How to Use This Info

### **1. Move Object to Known Position:**
- Place box at **X=0.35m (35cm right), Z=0.40m (40cm high)**
- Check if detections match: `X≈+0.35m, Z≈+0.40m`

### **2. Measure Object Size:**
- Box is 20cm × 30cm × 40cm high
- Move around all surfaces
- Check if X/Y/Z ranges match dimensions

### **3. Validate Coordinate System:**
- Move hand **left:** X should decrease
- Move hand **right:** X should increase
- Lift hand **up:** Z should increase
- Lower hand **down:** Z should decrease
