# üéØ Stereo Triangulation - The Correct Approach

## You're Right!

**Spatial filtering was completely wrong!** 

The fundamental principle of stereo vision is:
- **BOTH cameras MUST see the same object**
- The **intersection of their rays** gives the 3D position
- Filtering out one camera defeats the purpose!

---

## The Correct Stereo Principle

```
         Object at (X, Y, Z)
              ‚óè 
             /|\
            / | \
           /  |  \
          /   |   \
         /    |    \
    LEFT üëÅ  |    üëÅ RIGHT
   (0,0,0)   |   (0.5,0,0)
             |
      Ray intersection
      = True 3D position!
```

**Key insight:** The rays from both cameras should **intersect** (or come very close) at the object's true position.

## What We Were Doing Wrong

### **Current Method (Independent Accumulation):**
```python
# LEFT camera
for each motion pixel:
    ray = get_ray_from_left(pixel)
    voxels = traverse_ray(LEFT_POS, ray)
    accumulate(voxels)

# RIGHT camera  
for each motion pixel:
    ray = get_ray_from_right(pixel)
    voxels = traverse_ray(RIGHT_POS, ray)
    accumulate(voxels)
```

**Problem:** Each camera creates its own "cloud" of voxels along its ray. We hope they overlap, but there's no explicit intersection calculation.

---

## The Correct Method (Stereo Triangulation)

### **Step 1: Match Corresponding Points**

For each motion pixel in LEFT camera, find the corresponding pixel in RIGHT camera that's looking at the same 3D point.

**This is complex!** Stereo matching algorithms like:
- Feature matching
- Block matching
- Deep learning stereo

### **Step 2: Triangulate**

Given matched pixels:
- (px_left, py_left) in LEFT camera
- (px_right, py_right) in RIGHT camera

Calculate:
```python
ray_left = get_ray_from_calibration(px_left, py_left, LEFT_CAM)
ray_right = get_ray_from_calibration(px_right, py_right, RIGHT_CAM)

# Find intersection (or closest point)
point_3d = triangulate(ray_left, ray_right, LEFT_POS, RIGHT_POS)
```

## Simplified Approach for Your Case

Since you're detecting **motion** (not static scenes), we can use a simpler method:

### **Assumption:** 
If a pixel moves in both cameras at the same time, they're likely seeing the same object.

### **Algorithm:**

```python
# 1. Detect motion in both cameras
motion_left = detect_motion(cam_left)
motion_right = detect_motion(cam_right)

# 2. For each motion pixel in LEFT
for (py_left, px_left) in motion_left:
    ray_left = get_ray(px_left, py_left, LEFT)
    
    # 3. For each motion pixel in RIGHT
    for (py_right, px_right) in motion_right:
        ray_right = get_ray(px_right, py_right, RIGHT)
        
        # 4. Find closest point between rays
        point_3d, distance = closest_point_between_rays(
            LEFT_POS, ray_left,
            RIGHT_POS, ray_right
        )
        
        # 5. If rays are close (good intersection)
        if distance < threshold:  # e.g., 2cm
            # This is likely the same object!
            voxel = world_to_voxel(point_3d)
            voxel_grid[voxel] += confidence
```

## Ray-Ray Closest Point Algorithm

```python
def closest_point_between_rays(p1, d1, p2, d2):
    """
    Find closest point between two 3D rays.
    
    Ray 1: p1 + t*d1  (LEFT camera)
    Ray 2: p2 + s*d2  (RIGHT camera)
    
    Returns:
        point_3d: Midpoint of closest approach
        distance: Distance between rays at closest point
    """
    # Vector between ray origins
    w = p1 - p2
    
    a = np.dot(d1, d1)  # Length squared of d1
    b = np.dot(d1, d2)  # Dot product
    c = np.dot(d2, d2)  # Length squared of d2
    d = np.dot(d1, w)
    e = np.dot(d2, w)
    
    # Solve for parameters t and s
    denom = a * c - b * b
    
    if abs(denom) < 1e-6:
        # Rays are parallel
        return None, float('inf')
    
    t = (b * e - c * d) / denom
    s = (a * e - b * d) / denom
    
    # Points on each ray at closest approach
    point1 = p1 + t * d1
    point2 = p2 + s * d2
    
    # Midpoint (3D position estimate)
    point_3d = (point1 + point2) / 2
    
    # Distance between rays (triangulation error)
    distance = np.linalg.norm(point1 - point2)
    
    return point_3d, distance
```

## Why Your Calibration Data Shows the Issue

### **Your Data:**
```
LEFT recordings at X ‚âà 0.00m ‚úÖ
RIGHT recordings at X ‚âà -0.05m ‚ùå
```

**This actually makes sense for stereo!**

When object is at (0, 0, 0.2):
- LEFT camera at (0, 0, 0) sees it straight ahead: ray points to (0, 0, 0.2) ‚úÖ
- RIGHT camera at (0.5, 0, 0) sees it to the LEFT: ray points to ~(0, 0, 0.2)

But because of the **calibration being for origin**, the RIGHT camera's ray calculation is off!

---

## The Real Fix

### **Option 1: Separate Calibrations (Ideal)**

Calibrate each camera independently:
- `left_camera_calibration.yml`
- `right_camera_calibration.yml`

Each camera gets its own cx, cy, focal length, distortion.

### **Option 2: Stereo Calibration (Better)**

Use OpenCV's `stereoCalibrate()` which calibrates:
- Both cameras' intrinsics
- Rotation and translation between cameras
- **Accounts for camera positions!**

Output:
- Rectification matrices
- Projection matrices  
- Disparity-to-depth mapping

### **Option 3: Empirical Correction (Practical)**

Since your LEFT camera is accurate, use it as reference:

```python
# LEFT camera: Use calibration as-is
ray_left = calibration.get_ray_direction(px, py)

# RIGHT camera: Apply empirical offset
ray_right_raw = calibration.get_ray_direction(px, py)

# Correct for camera position offset
# Shift X-component based on measured error
correction_offset_x = 0.05  # From your data
ray_right_corrected = ray_right_raw + [correction_offset_x, 0, 0]
ray_right_corrected = normalize(ray_right_corrected)
```

## Immediate Action

Let me create a **stereo triangulation version** of the calibration tool that:

1. Captures motion from BOTH cameras simultaneously
2. Finds potential matches (temporal + intensity correlation)
3. Triangulates ray intersections
4. Records the intersection points
5. Validates stereo geometry

This will:
- ‚úÖ Use both cameras (correct stereo principle)
- ‚úÖ Find true 3D positions via triangulation
- ‚úÖ Reveal any calibration/geometry issues
- ‚úÖ Give you accurate baseline measurement

---

## Why This Explains Your Data

**With proper triangulation:**

Object at (0, Y, 0.2):
- LEFT ray from (0,0,0): direction [0, dy, dz]
- RIGHT ray from (0.5,0,0): direction [dx, dy, dz]
- Intersection should be at (0, Y, 0.2) ‚úÖ

**Currently (independent accumulation):**
- LEFT accumulates voxels along its ray: X ‚âà 0 ‚úÖ
- RIGHT accumulates voxels along its ray: X ‚âà -0.05 ‚ùå
- No intersection calculation!
- RIGHT camera calibration is off by 5cm

**Creating stereo triangulation version now...**

Your insight is correct - stereo needs BOTH cameras! üéØ
