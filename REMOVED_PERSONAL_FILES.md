# 🔒 Personal Files Removed

## ✅ Screenshots and Personal Images Excluded

The following files have been **removed from the Git repository** and will NOT be uploaded to GitHub:

### **Removed Files:**
- ✅ `SC1.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `SC2.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `SC3.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `SC4.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `SC5.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `SC6.png` - Screenshot (personal information)
- ✅ `pat.png` - Personal image
- ✅ `pattern.png` - Personal image

**Note:** These files are still on your local disk, just not in the Git repository.

---

## ✅ Files Kept in Repository

These PNG files are **kept** because they're essential and contain no personal data:

### **Essential Files:**
- ✅ `camera/aruco_board.png` - ArUco calibration board (needed for setup)
- ✅ `camera/test_images/test_left_1.png` - Example test image
- ✅ `camera/test_images/test_right_1.png` - Example test image

---

## 🛡️ Protection Added

Updated `.gitignore` to automatically exclude future screenshots:

```gitignore
# Screenshots and personal images (root level only)
/*.png

# But keep essential files:
!camera/aruco_board.png
!camera/test_images/*.png
```

**This means:**
- ✅ Any PNG in the root folder (like `SC*.png`) will be ignored
- ✅ ArUco board and test images are still included
- ✅ You can't accidentally add screenshots in the future

## 🚀 You're Safe to Push Now!

Your repository is now **clean of personal information**. Proceed with:

```powershell
# If you haven't configured git yet:
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Create the commit (safe now!)
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dual fisheye camera 3D voxel reconstruction system with ArUco calibration"

# Create repo on GitHub, then push
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/fisheye-stereo-voxel-reconstruction.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## 📋 What Will Be Uploaded

### **✅ Safe to Upload:**
- All Python source code
- All documentation (MD files)
- ArUco calibration board image
- Test images (no personal data)
- Configuration files
- Example voxel data

### **❌ NOT Uploaded:**
- Your screenshots (SC1-SC6.png)
- Personal images (pat.png, pattern.png)
- Future screenshots in root folder
- Captured camera images from calibration

## 🔍 Verify Yourself

To double-check what will be uploaded:

```powershell
# List all files staged for commit
git ls-files

# Search for PNG files specifically
git ls-files | findstr ".png"
```

**Expected output:**
```
camera/aruco_board.png
camera/test_images/test_left_1.png
camera/test_images/test_right_1.png
```

**Only these 3 PNG files** - no screenshots! ✅

---

## 💡 If You Add More Screenshots Later

Don't worry! The `.gitignore` rules will automatically exclude them:

```powershell
# This will be ignored automatically:
screenshot.png
debug.png
test.png

# These are still tracked:
camera/aruco_board.png
camera/test_images/anything.png
```
